# BSCScan-Helper
This application runs in the system tray only. Copy transaction hashes or addresses and use WIN+ESCAPE to open respective sites directly in the standard browser.

## Additional options in Appconfig:

- Set `UseInstantcopy` to `true` or `false` if you want to enable/disable automatic triggering of CTRL+C on selection
- change `Server` to use a different compatible service (like etherscan.io)
